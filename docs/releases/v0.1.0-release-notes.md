## Overview

We are excited to announce the initial release of **AINative Code** (v0.1.0) - a next-generation AI coding assistant that brings together the best features of modern AI CLI tools with native integration to the AINative platform ecosystem.

This foundational release establishes AINative Code as a production-ready tool for AI-assisted development, featuring support for 6 major LLM providers, a beautiful terminal interface, and comprehensive platform integrations.

## Highlights

### Multi-Provider LLM Support

Out of the box, AINative Code supports all major LLM providers:

- **Anthropic Claude** - Full support for Claude 3 models with streaming
- **OpenAI GPT** - GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo with organization settings
- **Google Gemini** - Gemini Pro with Vertex AI integration
- **AWS Bedrock** - Access to Claude and other models on AWS infrastructure
- **Azure OpenAI** - Azure-hosted OpenAI models with deployment management
- **Ollama** - Local execution of open-source models (LLAMA, Mistral, etc.)

All providers support streaming responses, configurable parameters, and automatic fallback mechanisms.

### Beautiful Terminal Interface

Built with Bubble Tea, the TUI provides:

- Sophisticated terminal UI with rich formatting
- Real-time streaming AI responses
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- LSP-powered code intelligence
- Extended thinking visualization
- Responsive keyboard navigation
- Color-coded, context-aware output

### AINative Platform Integration
